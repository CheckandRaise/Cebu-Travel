# Cebu - Philippines (Not Philips) 21. Jan. 2023 - 27. Jan 2023 (All public holidays of CUHK)
## Part 1 Introduction to Cebu
Cebu City, known as 宿务(宿雾), is a 1st class highly urbanized city in the Central Visayas region of the Philippines and capital of the Cebu Province.
Cebu is on an island away from Manila. As tourism is a thriving industry in Cebu, there is no need to worry about the security in Cebu.
