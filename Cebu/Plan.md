## Part 1 Introduction to Cebu
Cebu City, known as 宿务(宿雾), is a 1st class highly urbanized city in the Central Visayas region of the Philippines and capital of the Cebu Province.
Cebu is on an island away from Manila. As tourism is a thriving industry in Cebu, there is no need to worry about the security in Cebu.
